	<h1>Search Algorithms</h1>
	<h2>Linear Search</h2>
	<p>Linear search is a simple search algorithm that loops through an array or list of elements and checks if each element matches the target value. It is not suitable for large datasets, but it is easy to implement and understand.</p>
	<h2>Binary Search</h2>
	<p>Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays or lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, and checks if the target value is in the upper or lower half. If the target value is not found, the algorithm returns the index where the target value should be inserted.</p>
	<h2>Depth-First Search (DFS)</h2>
	<p>Depth-first search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is often used in backtracking problems, such as solving puzzles or generating permutations.</p>
	<h2>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h2>
	<p>Breadth-first search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the next level. It is often used in network analysis, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes.</p>
